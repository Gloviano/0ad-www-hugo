## Known Issues
Although we have made a great deal of progress, there are still many things left to implement and fix in 0 A.D. Here is a [full list here.](http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=15796)

- **Lag** – The game does not run as fast as we would like because of several reasons, mainly pertaining AI and pathfinding. The problem worsens in these conditions: (1) when there are many units on the map, (2) on island maps, and (3) with multiple AI players.
- **Visual glitches or textures not loaded** – Sometimes this is a driver problem. Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.
- **Missing animations** – Some units glide around or don’t drop to the ground when killed. This is a work in progress.
- **Sound problems** – We have implemented a new sound system in Alpha 11 and it still has several bugs. We intend to fix them in future alphas.
- **Errors and crashes** – Unfortunately, these can happen for many possible reasons, and a closer look is needed to determine the source of the problem. Please follow the instructions on this page to report any errors. Thanks in advance for helping us improve 0 A.D.
